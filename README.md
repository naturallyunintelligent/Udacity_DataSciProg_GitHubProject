# Udacity Github Version Control Project

This project is an interactive command line data analysis tool for analysing bikeshare data.

The user is prompted to select some filters (city/day/month), and the tool returns a summary of the filtered data.

It also has an additional option for displaying the filtered/total data 5 lines at a time.

This repo is for demonstrating use of version control, rather than the code itself.

## Files used

During the lessons, this came in handy to fix Jupyter notebook environments:

Setting up pre-commit was useful for keeping an eye on code style:
